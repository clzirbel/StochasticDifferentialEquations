<h1>
Downloading and running all Matlab programs</h1>
The file to be downloaded and expanded is <b>all.tar</b>, a file produced
by the UNIX program <b>tar</b>, which conglomerates many files into one.&nbsp;
Slightly different procedures need to be followed depending on what computer
you're using.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
On a Macintosh in the Scientific Computing Lab:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Launch Internet Explorer and open www-math.bgsu.edu/~zirbel/sde</li>

<li>
Click the link for all.tar.</li>

<li>
Internet Explorer's Download Manager will appear and the file all.tar
will be stored in some strange folder somewhere.</li>

<li>
In Download Manager, double click all.tar, then click on the button
Reveal in Finder.&nbsp; Now you can see where all.tar was put.</li>

<li>
Stuffit Expander should have already untarred the file all.tar and
put the various files it contains into a folder called something like <b>all
Folder</b>.</li>

<li>
Drag this folder onto the desktop.&nbsp; If you look at the contents, you
will see a bunch of .m files, which the Macintosh incorrectly assumes are
Mathematica files.</li>

<li>
Start Matlab by pulling down the Apple menu, Applications, Matlab 5.2.</li>

<li>
In Matlab, File, Open, Desktop, all Folder, and select something like
show.m.</li>

<li>
Once you have opened one program from this folder, you can run any program
from this folder by typing its name in the Matlab command window.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
On a UNIX machine such as gauss, euler, or bgunix:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Make sure you have a directory to put the files in.&nbsp; I suggest using
"mkdir sde" .&nbsp; Then change to that directory with "cd sde".</li>

<li>
Launch Netscape by typing "netscape &amp;" at the command line.&nbsp; The
&amp; will cause it to run in the background, allowing you to type further
commands.</li>

<li>
Open www-math.bgsu.edu/~zirbel/sde</li>

<li>
Click the link for all.tar.</li>

<li>
Netscape will ask you where you want to save this file.&nbsp; Specify the
directory you created above, and use the name all.tar</li>

<li>
In the UNIX command window, untar the file with the command "tar -xvf all.tar".</li>

<li>
Launch an editor so you can make changes to the files.&nbsp; I suggest
"jot" or "emacs"</li>

<li>
Now launch Matlab by typing "matlab".</li>

<li>
You can run programs by typing their name at the command window.&nbsp;
Try "walk"</li>
</ol>
