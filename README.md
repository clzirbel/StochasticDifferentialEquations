# Stochastic Differential Equations
This repository collects together programs to simulate and understand stochastic differential equations.
To understand SDE, it helps to run multiple simulations to get a sense for the variability in the realizations.
It also helps to read, edit, and write code, to understand how stochastic differential equations work.
